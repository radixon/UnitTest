# First Bad Version

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
<br /><br />
Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
<br /><br />
You are given an API isBadVersion(version: int)->bool which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
