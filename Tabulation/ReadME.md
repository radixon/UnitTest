# Tabulation

Tabulation is a bottom-up approach to dynamic programming.


Bottom-up is implemented with iteration and starts at the base cases. Let's use the Fibonacci sequence as an example again. The base cases for the Fibonacci sequence are 
F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.  With bottom-up, the base cases are used to calculate F(2).  Then F(2) is used in the tabulation of F(3), and so forth to F(n).
