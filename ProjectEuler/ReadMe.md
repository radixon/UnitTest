# Problem 1 <br />

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.<br />
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. <br />

# FizzBuzz <br />

If a number is a multiple of 3 the answer is Fizz.  If a number is a multiple of 5 the answer is Buzz.  If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 the answer is FizzBuzz.  Otherwise the answer is the value.

# Problem 2 <br />

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: <br />
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... <br /> <br />

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
