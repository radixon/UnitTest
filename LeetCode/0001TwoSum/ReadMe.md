TwoSum
To solve the two sum problem, a understanding of hashmaps is required.

A map is a generalized array that consists of key-value-pairs. The keys in a map can be of any data type and do not have to be consecutive values. find(key) has an O(1) expected time complexity. Storing the values in the hashmap is why it is O(n) space complexity.
