# TwoSum <br />

To solve the two sum problem, a understanding of hashmaps is required. <br />

A map is a generalized array that consists of key-value-pairs.  The keys in a map can be of any data type and do not have to be consecutive values.  find(key) has an O(1) expected time complexity. Storing the values in the hashmap is why it is O(n) space complexity. <br />

# Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

To solve this problem, the two pointer technique is required.  Using the two pointer technique with an already sorted array will solve this problem with an O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. <br />

The two pointer technique uses a pointer at the beginning and end of the array to iterate over the array. <br />

# 3Sum

To solve this problem, sort the array and use the two pointer technique.  Sorting the array will take O(n lg n) time.  If excluding the space required to store the answer, the complete algorithm takes O(1) space complexity. <br />
