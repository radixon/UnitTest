# TwoSum <br />

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. <br />
<br />
To solve this problem in O(n) time, sort the array and use the two pointer algorithm or use a hash table to store values.  Note hash tables are called dictionaries in Python.  Hash tables having O(1) lookup for average and amoritized cases.  See section 5.5 Dictionaries of Python documentation, docs.python.org. <br />

# Best Day to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.  You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
 <br /><br />   
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0. <br />

# Contains Duplicate [Array]

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct. <br />

# Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. <br />
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.  You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation. <br />

# Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. <br />
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. <br />

# Maximum Product Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product. <br />
The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
