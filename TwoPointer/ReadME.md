# Two Pointer Technique

In the two pointers method, two pointers are used to iterate through the array values. Both pointers can move to one direction only, which ensures that the algorithm works efficiently. <br /><br />

The left pointer starts at the first value and moves one step to the right based on some condition. The right pointer begins at the last value and moves to the left based on some condition. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), as the algorithm has to iterate through the array. The space complexity is O(1), as the only space used contains the left and right pointer.
