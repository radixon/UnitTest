# Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. <br /><br />
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

# Intuition

This is a common "counting" problem found in advanced probability textbooks.  At each step, the previous two steps determine how many possibilities there are to climb the stairs from the current location.  This follows the Fibonacci Sequence.
